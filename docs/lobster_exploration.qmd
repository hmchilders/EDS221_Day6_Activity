# Task 2: Lobsters

Attach the necessary libraries for the program

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
```

Read in the Lobster Data File

N/A values in this dataset are stored as either "-99999" or blank cells

janitor::clean_names() \<- changes all the column names to lower snake case

dplyr::uncount(count) \<- duplicates rows according to the weighting variable in the column "COUNT"

```{r}
lobsters <- read_csv(here("data","Lobster_Abundance_All_Years_20210412.csv"), na = c("-99999", "")) %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  uncount(count)
```

```{r}
summarize(lobsters, )
```
